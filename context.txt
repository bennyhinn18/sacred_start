Great, Sam. Let's **go all in** on building your **Distraction-Free Bible Reading App**. We'll name it for now as:

> 🕊️ **"Sacred Start"** – Start your day with the Word, not the world.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Goal: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**Timeframe**: 30 days (Daily 2-hour commitment)

We'll break it down week-by-week and provide file names and tasks.

---

### 🧱 Week 1: App Skeleton + Bible Reader UI

**🗂️ Files:**

* `main.dart`
* `screens/home_screen.dart`
* `screens/bible_reader_screen.dart`
* `data/bible_data.dart`
* `services/reading_progress_service.dart`

**🔨 Tasks:**

* Set up Flutter project: `flutter create sacred_start`
* Load Bible chapters (use JSON for now, e.g., Genesis 1–3).
* Create a Bible reading screen with:

  * Chapter navigation.
  * Last read saved in local storage.
* Build home screen with:

  * “Start Reading” button.
  * “Church Mode” toggle (initially just UI).
* Use `shared_preferences` package to store reading progress.

---

### 🚫 Week 2: Lockdown Mode + Notification Blocker

**🗂️ Files:**

* `services/lockdown_service.dart`
* `screens/lockdown_config_screen.dart`

**🔨 Tasks:**

* Ask for:

  * Usage Access Permission
  * DND access
* Build Lockdown Timer (e.g., 6:00 AM–6:30 AM)
* Block apps by:

  * Getting foreground apps
  * Overlaying blocking screen (needs Accessibility Service)
* Hide notifications during lockdown using DND mode

---

### 🔁 Week 3: Reminder System + Gamification

**🗂️ Files:**

* `services/reminder_service.dart`
* `widgets/streak_widget.dart`
* `models/streak_model.dart`

**🔨 Tasks:**

* Add local notifications using `flutter_local_notifications`.
* Build streak system:

  * Daily check-in = +1 streak.
  * Missed = streak reset (optional grace).
* Show motivational message after reading.

---

### 🙏 Week 4: Church Mode + Final Polish

**🗂️ Files:**

* `services/church_mode_service.dart`
* `screens/settings_screen.dart`

**🔨 Tasks:**

* Toggle to activate “Church Mode”:

  * DND + screen timeout + hide distracting apps.
  * Optional: schedule (e.g., every Sunday 9 AM–12 PM)
* Add settings screen to customize:

  * Whitelisted apps
  * Plan type (NT only / Whole Bible / Custom)

---

## 🗂️ Bible Data (Plan Suggestion)

### Format: `assets/plans/daily_plan.json`

```json
[
  { "day": 1, "book": "Genesis", "chapter": 1 },
  { "day": 2, "book": "Genesis", "chapter": 2 },
  ...
]
```

We'll create a parser to display today’s reading and track progress.

## 🧠 Skills You’ll Learn

* Flutter + State Management
* Using Android Permissions (advanced like Usage Access)
* Local data persistence
* Scheduling notifications
* Blocking logic (Accessibility APIs)

---

## ⚡️ Want me to generate project structure with boilerplate code (week 1)?

I'll generate:

* `main.dart`
* Basic routing
* JSON data format for Bible
* Reading screen UI

**Just reply:** “Yes, start with week 1 code”.

We'll go **step by step** and you'll build a beautiful, purpose-driven app by the end of the month.
